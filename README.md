A deep learning approach for recognizing whether a person has worn a mask or not. Whole process will accept input as an image which contains the face of a human being that will be input for CNN model and The model will predict output accordingly. CNN resnet-18 model is used to train on a dataset. In the proposed study, The model is being trained with the help of pytorch, a python based framework for deep learning. The testing accuracy is 97.38%. No pretrained parameters are being considered as the proposed case study is somewhat different compared to classes on which model is already being trained.<br>
